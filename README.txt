NOTES
~~~~~~~

To PAUSE (A) or TOGGLE MODES (SELECT) you must hold the button
& wait for the next tic of the game before it will process the 
switch.

When switching to EDIT MODE use arrow keys to move cursor &
see location. When running SIM cursor does not disappear right
away because sim is updating slowly.

On my computer this program was EXTREMELY slow (7-8 secs) between
each tick. Please keep this in mind while grading - it works it's
just slow!

Also, the poop is just cause this homework was super stinky for me
and not anything against you!
